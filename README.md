# Python-Based Command Terminal (Hackathon Project)

## Overview
This project is built for the **CodeMate Hackathon** under the problem statement:

> **Develop a fully functioning command terminal that mimics the behavior of a real system terminal.**  
> Backend must be Python. Terminal should support standard commands and Python execution.  

Our implementation:
- Python backend using **Flask**
- Web-based terminal UI built with **HTML + JS**
- Supports:
  - File/command operations (`ls`, `pwd`, etc. — extendable)
  - Python execution via `!py <code>` or a code runner textbox
- Deployed live on **CodeMate Build**

## Features
- ✅ Python backend (Flask)
- ✅ Web terminal interface
- ✅ `/local_run` endpoint executes Python code with timeout and size limits
- ✅ Clean frontend with a textarea + Run button
- ✅ Terminal input supports `!py` prefix for Python commands
- ⚡ Optional enhancements possible (command history, AI-driven natural language)
